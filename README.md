# KidsRuby Editor (CoffeeScript + Chromeless edition)

This is a spike to explore powering the [KidsRuby](http://kidsruby.com) [Editor](https://github.com/hybridgroup/kidsruby) through [Chromeless](http://mozillalabs.com/chromeless/).

This is also an experiment to see if this can be done cleanly with [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/).
