  <article class="lesson"><h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <section class="page"><h1>This is KidsRuby</h1>
      <p>Hi, and welcome to KidsRuby. We hope you are ready to have fun learning how to make computers do whatever you want them to.</p>

  <article class="lesson"><h1>What is Ruby?</h1>
    <section class="page"><h1>Ruby is a programming language</h1>
      <p>The way you tell a computer what to do, is by learning a special language that the computer can understand. This kind of special language is called a 'programming language'. KidsRuby lets you program in the most awesome computer language ever, Ruby.</p>
      <p>Ruby was invented in Japan by a very cool guy named Matz. His real name is Yukihiro Matsumoto, but everyone calls him Matz. He has given away his Ruby programming language to the world to use for free. That is pretty cool.</p>

  <article class="lesson"><h1>How To Make It Work</h1>
    <section class="page"><h1>Type in some Ruby to the left, then click 'Run'</h1>
      <p>You make KidsRuby work by doing this:</p>
      <p>1. Type in some Ruby 'code' to the left, just below where it says "Type in your code just below here:".</p>
      <p>2. Click on the "Run" button. This will cause the computer to look at the Ruby you typed in, and do whatever it says to do.</p>
      <p>3. Watch the computer do whatever you have told it to!</p>
      <p>Don't worry if you do not know how to write Ruby yet. That is what this Help system is designed to do.</p>

  <article class="lesson"><h1>Saving and Opening Your Code</h1>
    <section class="page"><h1>You can save your code, and reopen it later</h1>
      <p>You can save your program with KidsRuby by doing this:</p>
      <p>1. Type in some Ruby 'code' to the left, just below where it says "Type in your code just below here:".</p>
      <p>2. Click on the "Save" button down at the bottom of where you typed your code. This will pop up something that will ask you where you want to save the file.</p>
      <p>3. Enter in the name for your new file. Make sure you name it somthing that ends with ".rb" like "mywork.rb"</p>
      <p>4. Click on the "Save" button. Now you have saved your program, and can reopen it later, by clicking on the "Open" button!</p>

  <article class="lesson"><h1>What To Do Next</h1>
    <section class="page"><h1>Go 'Back to Lessons', and check out "Hackety Hack"</h1>
      <p>Once upon a time there was an amazing guy named "_why the lucky stiff". He made a lot of programs using Ruby, and one of them was named Hackety Hack. It was designed to help kids learn how to program in Ruby.</p>
      <p>One day, _why disappeared. He probably vanished and went back to whatever magic programming world he had originally came from. He left behind some great ideas, and we have tried to make KidsRuby with his spirit of fun and discovery. That is "_why" we have included some of his writings here for you to learn from. Have fun!</p>
