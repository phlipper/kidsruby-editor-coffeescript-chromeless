  <article class="lesson"><h1>Hello there!</h1>
    <section class="page"><h1>Let's get started</h1>
      <p>Welcome to your first lesson in Ruby! You're going to have a blast.</p>
      <p>Ruby is a great programming language that you can use to make all kinds of things with. Let's get going!</p>
    </section>
  </article>

  <article class="lesson"><h1>A bit more about Ruby</h1>
    <section class="page"><h1>Konnichiwa, Ruby!</h1>
      <p><em>Ruby</em> was created by</p>
      <p>まつもと ゆきひろ</p>
      <p>(you can just call him Matz) in 1995. If you couldn't guess, Matz is from Japan. Here he is:</p>
    </section>
    <section class="page"><h1>Ruby is enjoyable</h1>
      <p>Matz has this to say about Ruby:</p>
      <p><em>I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language.</em></p>
      <p>One more thing about Ruby: Rubyists (that's what people who like Ruby call themselves) have a saying: <strong>MINSWAN</strong>. This stands for <strong>M</strong>atz <strong>I</strong>s <strong>N</strong>ice <strong>S</strong>o <strong>W</strong>e <strong>A</strong>re <strong>N</strong>ice. Which is a pretty nice saying, itself. Be nice to everyone, and give them a hand when they need it!"</p>
    </section>
  </article>

  <article class="lesson"><h1>Displaying Things</h1>
    <section class="page"><h1>Let's do this!</h1>
      <p>Okay! The very first thing that you need to know is how to show something on the screen. Otherwise, you won't know what's going on!</p>
    </section>
    <section class="page"><h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      <p>There are two ways of doing this. Here's the first: alert</p>
      <code>alert "Hello, world!"</code>
      <p>Type this in and press the 'Run' button.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="page"><h1>alert</h1>
      <p>Okay, let's break this down: There's two main parts to this little program: you have an <code>alert</code> and a <code>"Hello, world!"</code>. These two parts work just like an English sentence: The <code>alert</code> is a verb and the stuff in the ""s is an object. In Ruby, we call verbs <strong>methods</strong>. The <code>alert</code> verb says 'Put an alert box on the screen, and the content of the box is whatever thing you give me.'</p>
      <p>We'll talk about the <code>"Hello, world!"</code> in just a second. Here's the other way of making this happen:</p>
      <code>puts "Hello, world!"</code>
      <p>If you try that here, it will work! The <code>puts</code> method doesn't display a dialog box, it puts text out to the output instead. We'll be using <code>alert</code>s throughout these tutorials, but if you look at other Ruby tutorials, you may see <code>puts</code>.</p>
    </section>
  </article>

  <article class="lesson"><h1>Letters, words, and sentences</h1>
    <section class="page"><h1> Strings </h1>
      <p> Okay! Now that you've got that verb bit down, it's time to learn about <em>String</em>s. Strings are what we call a bunch of words between a pair of \" characters. The \"s are used to tell the computer what words you actually want to say. Let's think about our example:<p>
      <code>alert "Hello, world!"</code>
      <p>If you didn't have the \"s, the computer wouldn't know which words were methods and which ones were part of the string! And consider this:</p>
      <code>alert "I am on high alert!"</code>
      <p>Without making all of those words a string, how would Ruby know that the second alert was some text you wanted to say, rather than another alert box?</p>
    </section>
    <section class="page"><h1>Adding Strings </h1>
      <p>Now, if you want to put two bits of strings together, you can use the <code>+</code> character to do it. Try typing this:<p>
      <code>alert "Hello, " + "world!"</code>
      <p>Same thing! The <code>+</code> sticks the two strings together. This will end up being super useful later!</p>
    </section>
  </article>

  <article class="lesson"><h1>Numbers and Math</h1>
    <section class="page"><h1> Numbers </h1>
      <p>You can just use numbers, and Ruby understands them:<p>
      <code>alert 2</code>
      <p>You can even use numbers that have a decimal point in them:<p>
      <code>alert 1.5</code>
    </section>
    <section class="page"><h1> Basic Math </h1>
      <p>You can also do math with numbers, and it'll work out pretty well:<p>
      <code>alert 1 + 2</code><br/>
      <code>alert 5 - 3</code><br/>
      <code>alert 2 * 3</code><br/>
      <code>alert 4 / 2</code>
      <p><p>
      <p>But if you try this, nothing happens:<p>
      <code>alert "hey" + 2</code>
      <p>This is kind of fun and silly, though:<p>
      <code>alert "hey" * 2</code>
    </section>
    <section class="page"><h1>Errors </h1>
      <p>You know how nothing happened when you hit the Run button earlier? That was because there was an error. You can see any errors that run by hitting either Alt-/ or Command-/, depending on what kind of computer you're using.<p>
      <p>The error that results from <code>alert "hey" + 2</code> is:</p>
      <code>can't convert Fixnum into String</code>
      <p>What is that?</p>
    </section>
  </article>

  <article class="lesson"><h1>A few words about types</h1>
    <section class="page"><h1> Why's it do that? </h1>
      <p>Each part of a Ruby program is an <code>Object</code>. Right now, all you need to know about <code>Object</code>s is that it's sort of like saying a thing. Your program is made up of a bunch of <code>Object</code>s working together.</p>
      <p>We'll learn more about <code>Object</code>s in a future lesson, but there is one thing I'll tell you: <code>Object</code>s have a 'type.' This lets Ruby know what kind of <code>Object</code> it is. </p>
    </section>
    <section class="page"><h1>Adding numbers to words</h1>
      <p>That's why</p>
      <code>alert "hey" + 2</code>
      <p>doesn't really work: "hey" is a <code>String</code> object, and 2 is a <code>Fixnum</code> object. And adding <code>String</code>s and <code>Fixnum</code>s doesn't make any sense. We can make this code work, though!</p>
      <p>All we need to do is turn the <code>Fixnum</code> into a <code>String</code>. We can do this by using the <code>to_s</code> method.</p>
      <code>alert "hey" + 2.to_s</code>
    </section>
    <section class="page"><h1>Let's look at that again</h1>
      <code>alert "hey" + 2.to_s</code>
      <p>Okay, this isn't bad. We have our <code>alert</code> method. We're giving it <code>"hey" + 2.to_s</code>. The <code>2.to_s</code> turns a <code>Fixnum</code> 2, which is like the mathematical idea of a 2, into the <code>String</code> 2, which is like when you write a 2 down on a piece of paper.</p>
    </section>

  <article class="lesson"><h1>Variables</h1>
    <section class="page"><h1> They're like boxes </h1>
      <p>What happens if we want to keep something around? Most programs are not one line, I assure you. You can use a <em>variable</em> to hold a value and use it later. It's like a box that you put things in.</p>
      <p>Let's try one out:</p>
<pre><code>message = "Hello, world!
  alert message</code></pre>
      <p>Give that a run.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="page"><h1> Assignment </h1>
      <p>Cool stuff! We used an <code>=</code> to <em>assign</em> the <code>String</code> "Hello, world!" into the variable <code>message</code>. We then passed that <code>message</code> to the <code>alert</code> method.</p>
      <p>As you can see, we can use variables in place of another value. Try this:</p>
<pre><code>number = 5
  number = number * 2
  number = number - 8
  number = number + 1
  alert number</code></pre>
      <p>Make a guess before you run this program.</p>
    </section>
  </article>

  <article class="lesson"><h1>User Input</h1>
    <section class="page"><h1>ask-ing for it.</h1>
      <p>We can ask the user of our program for some input, and then put their answer into a variable. It's easy! Check this program out:</p>
<pre><code>name = ask "What is your name?
  alert "Hello, " + name'</code></pre>
      <p>The <code>ask</code> method brings up a box and lets our users type something in. Fun! We put their answer into the <code>name</code> variable and then showed it with <code>alert</code> Sweet!</p>
    </section>
  </article>

  <article class="lesson"><h1>Basic flow control</h1>
    <section class="page"><h1> if... </h1>
      <p>Remember back to that Beginning Programming lesson... we talked about how programs are one big list, that the computer follows in order.</p>
      <p>Well, guess what? We can actually change this order by using certain bits of code. Compare these two programs:</p>
<pre><code>number = 2
if number == 2
  alert "Yes!
else
  alert "No!"
end</code></pre>
<pre><code>number = 1
if number == 2
  alert "Yes!"
else
  alert "No!"
end</code></pre>
      <p>There are a few new things here.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="page"><h1>"=="</h1>
      <p>Here it is again:</p>
<pre><code>number = 2
if number == 2
  alert "Yes!"
else
  alert "No!"
end</code></pre>
      <p>The == command is just a bit different than the = command. == tests the <code>Object</code> on its right against the <code>Object</code> on its left. If the two are equal, then the code after the <code>if</code> will run. If they're not equal, you get the code after the <code>else</code>. The <code>("end")</code> lets us know we're done with our <code>if</code>.</p>
    </section>
  </article>

  <article class="lesson"><h1>Example: a guessing game</h1>
    <section class="page"><h1> Guess! </h1>
      <p>Let's put this all together:</p>
<pre><code>secret_number = 42.to_s
guess = ask "I have a secret number. Take a guess!"
if guess == secret_number
  alert "Yes! You guessed right!"
else
  alert "Sorry, you\'ll have to try again."
end</code></pre>
          <p>Can you guess what <code>to_s</code> does, and why you need it? If you're stumped, try asking KidsRuby on Twitter and we'll give you a hand.</p>

      <p>Here's what you've learned so far:</p>
      <p>* <code>alert</code> and <code>ask</code></p>
      <p>* <code>=</code> variables, and <code>==</code></p>
      <p>* <code>if</code> and <code>else</code></p>
      <p>Awesome! You'll want to check out Basic Shoes next!</p>
